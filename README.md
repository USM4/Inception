# NOTHING TO EXPLAIN


CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
u tell nginx to set a global directive with the -g option, the directive here is to run nginx as a foreground process instead of as a daemon (bg process) to prevent the contianer from stopping.

**Volumes**
>In the context of Docker, a volume is a way to persist data generated by containers or to share data between containers and the host system. Volumes are used to store data independently of the container's lifecycle, allowing it to persist even if the container is removed or replaced.

**TLS/SSL**
>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. They establish an encrypted connection between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website), ensuring that data transmitted between them remains confidential and cannot be tampered with.

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PHP REQUEST SENT TO NGINX**  
>>Request Arrives at NGINX:  
When a request is made to the NGINX server, it first listens for incoming connections on port 443 (HTTPS) as specified   by listen 443 ssl;.    
SSL/TLS Handshake:    
  
Once a connection is established, NGINX performs the SSL/TLS handshake with the client using the specified SSL protocols   (ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;).    
It presents the SSL certificate (/etc/nginx/ssl/inception.crt) and its corresponding private key (/etc/nginx/ssl/  inception.key) to the client.    
Determine Server Block:    
  
NGINX evaluates the server_name directive to determine which server block should handle the request. In this case, if   the request matches the domain oredoine.42.fr, this server block will be used.  
Serve Static Files:  
  
If the requested resource is a static file (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), NGINX serves it directly from the specified   root directory (/var/www/html).  
Process PHP Files:  
  
If the requested resource is a PHP file (identified by the location block location ~ \.php$ { ... }):  
NGINX includes the snippets/fastcgi-php.conf file, which contains FastCGI configurations for handling PHP requests.
